        "original_content": "WhenVanMoof declared bankruptcylast year, it left around 5,000 customers who had pre-ordered e-bikes in the lurch. Now VanMoof is up and running under new management, and the company\u2019s current owners are courting those same customers by offering them a \u20ac1,000 discount off a new bike.It\u2019s an audacious strategy, one that bets on jilted customers lovingVanMoof\u2019s bikesso much that they\u2019ll shell out several thousand more euro for them.Before it went bust, VanMoof had asked customers to pay close to the full amount when they pre-ordered, in a move designed to give the startup working capital that also resulted in long wait times for delivery.\u00a0The bikes cost anywhere from \u20ac2,300 to \u20ac2,500, depending on the model and year.Today\u2019s models \u2013 thefull-sized S5with 27.5-inch wheels and a straight frame, as well as thesmaller A5with 24-inch wheels and a step-through frame \u2013 cost \u20ac3,298. Which means customers who want to take advantage of this discount will have to put down another \u20ac2,298 on top of what they already paid for their undelivered e-bike. Simply put, they\u2019d be spending close to \u20ac5,600 all together for one VanMoof bike.\u201cObviously it\u2019s not a full resolution. We\u2019re very much aware of that,\u201d Eliott Wertheimer, VanMoof\u2019s co-CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cThe way we see it is this is a gesture to help people get back on the road who still believe in [VanMoof].\u201dBeforegoing bankruptin July 2023, VanMoof had raised close to$200 million in venture capitaland gained acult followingon the vision of its sleek, trendy, uncluttered e-bikes designed end-to-end and controlled by an integrated app. The style was there, but the startup lacked execution. Using bespoke parts meant the bikes often broke, and it was difficult to replace those parts in a timely manner, especially without a robust servicing network in place. The company also used its VC money to artificially lower prices in a way that quickly became unsustainable, according to Wertheimer.Lavoie, a division of McLaren Applied that was formed in 2022 to build e-scooters,acquired VanMoof in August 2023. Since then, Lavoie has worked to re-establish VanMoof\u2019s supply chain and set up a wide service network throughout Europe and parts of the U.S.; reinvigorate VanMoof\u2019s technical ecosystem, including its apps and website; and re-engineer VanMoof\u2019s core products. In other words, today VanMoof claims to offer more reliable, repairable e-bikes that have gone through McLaren\u2019s testing and design iteration process.\u201cWe\u2019re past restructuring, we\u2019re past restarting. We\u2019re getting into how we re-establish the brand and relaunch,\u201d said Wertheimer. \u201cAn ongoing consideration throughout this whole journey was what can we do for people who didn\u2019t get their bikes?\u201dApparently, the answer to that question is to try and hook customers with discounts instead of giving them their money back because that money is tied up in bankruptcy proceedings. Wertheimer told TechCrunch the money customers used to pay for their bikes, as well as the bikes themselves, are part of the bankruptcy estate, which is being managed by the estate\u2019s administrators in the Netherlands. That means Lavoie doesn\u2019t have access to those funds.\u201cSo anything we could do to support people who didn\u2019t get their bikes from the old company will effectively has to come out of our own pocket,\u201d said Wertheimer, noting that \u20ac1,000 is the most Lavoie could afford \u201cwithout threatening our existence.\u201dWertheimer also noted that the bankruptcy process is ongoing, and customers still stand to get partial refunds through that once it\u2019s resolved. Although, given what is likely a long line of secured creditors and priority unsecured creditors ahead of those customers (not to mention legal fees associated with the bankruptcy process), customers probably shouldn\u2019t hold their breath.For those who do want to sign up for the discount, they can applyhere, but get ready for a somewhat convoluted process.When Lavoie took over VanMoof, it wasn\u2019t able to access the company\u2019s customer orders due to a combination of a chaotic back end and data sharing constraints from Europe\u2019s GDPR regulation. That means customers who want to cash in their discount will need to reach out to VanMoof directly and show documentation to prove they made an order.They\u2019ll also need to go through the rigamarole of trying to get a refund from their bank via a chargeback, if they haven\u2019t already. VanMoof will only provide discounts to people who can prove that they tried and failed to get their money back this way.For those who are happy to follow all those steps and ante up, they have until December 31, 2027 to apply their discount.It\u2019s unclear if VanMoof\u2019s strategy will pay off. One thing is certain: The startup\u2019s future hinges on its ability to regain customer trust and deliver on its promises. Customers will have to decide on whether the allure of a sexy, re-engineered e-bike is worth the price and the effort, or if past failures will keep them away for good.",
        "paraphrased_content": "## VanMoof's Risky Gamble: Discounting Bikes to Former Customers\n\n<p>After declaring bankruptcy last year, VanMoof, a Dutch e-bike manufacturer, left thousands of pre-order customers in the lurch. Now, under new management, VanMoof is trying to win back those customers with a \u20ac1,000 discount on new bikes.  This audacious strategy bets on customers' continued affection for VanMoof's bikes, despite the company's past struggles.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to its bankruptcy, VanMoof required customers to pay nearly the full amount upfront for pre-orders, which resulted in long delays. The company's bikes cost between \u20ac2,300 and \u20ac2,500, but now, the new S5 and A5 models retail for \u20ac3,298.  To claim the discount, former customers must pay an additional \u20ac2,298 on top of their previous payments, essentially spending close to \u20ac5,600 for a single bike.</p>\n\n<p>VanMoof co-CEO, Eliott Wertheimer, acknowledges that the discount is not a complete resolution, but sees it as a gesture of goodwill for those who still believe in the brand. Before its collapse, VanMoof had raised significant funding and attracted a loyal following thanks to its sleek and stylish e-bikes. However, the company's bespoke parts caused frequent breakdowns, and the lack of a robust servicing network made repairs difficult.  Additionally, artificially low pricing led to unsustainable business practices.</p>\n\n<p>Lavoie, a division of McLaren Applied, acquired VanMoof in August 2023.  Since then, Lavoie has been working to address VanMoof's past shortcomings by rebuilding its supply chain, expanding its service network, and improving its technical ecosystem. The company claims its new bikes are more reliable and repairable thanks to McLaren's design and testing process.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the company's efforts, customers who lost money due to the bankruptcy will not receive full refunds. This is because those funds are part of the bankruptcy estate, which is being managed by administrators in the Netherlands.  Lavoie is therefore offering the discount out of its own pocket, with Wertheimer stating that \u20ac1,000 is the maximum they can afford.</p>\n\n<p>To claim the discount, customers must prove they made a pre-order and have attempted to get a refund from their bank. The discount is valid until December 31, 2027, but the process to claim it is complex. VanMoof's data is currently inaccessible due to data sharing limitations imposed by the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>\n\n<p>VanMoof's future hinges on its ability to regain customer trust and deliver on its promises.  Whether former customers will be willing to overlook the company's past failures and embrace its new direction remains to be seen.  The decision boils down to whether the allure of a redesigned e-bike outweighs the price, the effort, and the risk.</p> \n",

        "category": "Climate",
        "timeposted": "2024-07-15 05:27:20",
        "original_content": "Rice is the staple crop of more than half of the world\u2019s population. Demand is growing with the rising population in South and Southeast Asia. However, a significant portion of rice farming still relies on traditional cultivation methods that lead to substantial methane emissions, which are a major contributor to climate change \u2014 methane is nearly30 times as potent as carbon dioxidewhen it comes to warming the atmosphere, although it dissipates faster. Growing rice also requires a considerable amount of freshwater, around 3,000 liters for every kilogram of rice, or 20 million liters for every hectare of a rice farm.Mitti Labs aims to limit methane emissions and water wastage in rice farming using its technology solutions. Co-founded by Harvard Business School graduates Xavier Laguarta and Devdut Dalal, the firm has now raised $3 million in an equity investment as it aims to reduce methane emissions by 50% and water consumption by 30% with tech such as high-resolution satellite imagery and on-ground gas chambers.The New York City-headquartered startup, with a subsidiary based in India\u2019s Bengaluru, launched in May last year and has chosen India as its primary market. India is the world\u2019s second-largest rice producer, yet the livelihoods of its rice farmers face imminent threats from climate change, which has resulted in a significant decline in water levels and an increasing amount of methane in its atmosphere.Laguarta and Dalal conceptualized Mitti Labs last year after meeting during their master\u2019s in business administration at Harvard Business School. Before beginning the startup, Laguarta had experience in sustainability consulting, while Dalal worked in the food and agricultural supply chain. A third-cofounder, CTO Nathan Torbick, also signed on.\u201cWhen you look at the agriculture space, there\u2019s been so much done, and regenerative agriculture is something that people talk about all over the world. But when you look at the amount of people who are trying to tackle rice specifically, it is so much smaller than most other crops,\u201d Laguarta said in an interview.Mitti Labs co-founders Nathan Torbick, Xavier Laguarta and Devdut Dalal (left to right)Image Credits:Mitti LabsMeasuring emissions, selling carbon creditsRice producesabout half the greenhouse gas emissionsfrom croplands, including 30% of agricultural methane emissions. However, farmscan cut methane emissionsfrom rice cultivations to a large extent by improving water management or alternating wetting and drying.Working with the not-for-profit Syngenta Foundation and Dr. Reddy\u2019s Foundation, as well as Spanish food processing company Ebro Foods, Mitti Labs has launched five projects across India to help farmers adopt and implement sustainable farming techniques, avoid stubble burning and use limited water. These rice projects cover 30,000 hectares in area and will help cut 120,000 metric tonnes of CO2e emissions, the startup said.Mitti Labs aims to work with more than 40,000 smallholder farmers to embed and measure sustainable agricultural practices that will not only improve the environmental aspect of rice farming but also help farmers raise their annual incomes by up to 30%, as the startup will enable them to earn money from carbon credits it will sell on their behalf in the market.Convincing smallholder farmers to embrace new techniques sometimes becomes challenging, as they often hesitate to move away from their traditional practices. However, Dalal told TechCrunch that Mitti Labs provides support and advice to farmers and offers them regular touchpoints through its on-ground implementation partners.\u201cOur team works with implementation partners, continuously refining the pitch to farmers; what works in one village, might not work in another. So the behavior change element has to be very targeted, and completely aligned with the local communities need,\u201d he said.On the tech side, Mitti Labs uses a remote-sensing platform which helps measure climate impact using satellite imagery. The startup buys high-resolution imagery captured using synthetic aperture radars from SAOCOM and Umbra and fuses it with openly available satellite imagery to understand farmers\u2019 practices. The high-resolution imagery comes through SARs penetrating objects on Earth\u2019s surface using different wavelengths to measure characters such as water level, soil moisture, and plant growth.Alongside satellite imagery, Mitti Labs uses greenhouse gas chambers on ground to capture methane and nitrous oxide fluxes coming out in the field. The data from these chambers goes into a software model and is processed by third-party labs to calculate emissions.In terms of carbon credits, Mitti Labs worked with Cornell University, the International Rice Research Institute and the U.S. Department of Agriculture for about 12 months, running experiments with satellite imagery and gas chamber data to test and advance its measurement practices. This in turn is meant to help buyers in Europe and the U.S. purchase carbon credits with confidence.Mitti Labs currently works with Gold Standard for issuing carbon credits. However, Laguarta told TechCrunch that the startup may expand to Verra as it scales the business.Converting carbon credits into real money takes some time. Laguarta said Mitti Labs is currently in the due diligence stages with the projects it has launched. The startup aims for at least 70% of the profits it garners from carbon projects to be distributed among farmers that transitioned their rice farming practices. This will be an additional revenue stream for these farmers. The remaining amount will be divided among Mitti Labs\u2019 partners and the startup itself, the co-founder said.Mitti Labs works with on-ground implementation partners to provide regular touchpoints to rice farmersImage Credits:Mitti LabsThe success of its first five projects will help Mitti Labs to scale its presence. The startup already has 10 more projects in the works, and plans to expand geographically and enter Bangladesh, Thailand and Vietnam.Laguarta told TechCrunch that Mitti Labs has already found the \u201cright local partners\u201d in the new markets and is discussing financing local projects with project investors and carbon offset buyers. The plan is to start them by the end of 2024 or sometime in 2025. Nevertheless, the startup considers India to remain its focused market.\u201cIndia is our first market, and India is the market that we think we have a very strong passion to make an impact on,\u201d Laguarta said.Mitti Labs is not the only startup enabling sustainable farming in India.RTP Global-backed Varahais among the existing players in that domain. However, Laguarta said most of these startups do not specifically focus on one crop.\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to do five different things, I think that\u2019s a good strategy for some people. For us, the importance is we want to be the best in rice farming, and we believe that there should be someone who\u2019s the best at agroforestry and someone who\u2019s the best at biochar and other things,\u201d he said.Mitti Labs\u2019 maiden funding was co-led by Lightspeed and Voyager, along with early support from Harvard Innovation Labs.",

        "original_content": "More and more hackers are targeting regular people with the goal of stealing their crypto, perhaps getting into their bank accounts,or simply stalking them. These types of attacks are still relatively rare, so there\u2019s no need for alarm. But it\u2019s important to know what you can do to protect yourself if you suspect someone got into your email or social media account.A few years ago,I wrote a guideto help people protect themselves, and understand that most of the companies you have an account with already offer you tools to take control of your accounts\u2019 security, even before you contact them for help, which in some cases you still should do.Here we break down what you can do on several different online services.Just like in the previous guide, there\u2019s an important caveat. You should know that these methods don\u2019t guarantee that you haven\u2019t been compromised. If you still aren\u2019t sure, you should contact a professional, especially if you are a journalist, a dissident or activist, or otherwise someone who has a higher risk of being targeted. In those cases, the non-profit Access Nowhas a digital security helplinethat will connect you to one of their experts.Another caveat, if you don\u2019t do this already, youshould enable multi-factor authenticationon all your accounts, or at least the most important ones (email, banking, social media).This directory is a great resourcethat teaches you how to enable multi-factor authentication on more than 1,000 websites. (Note that you don\u2019t have to use the multi-factor app promoted on that site, thereareplentyof otheralternatives.)Increasingly some online services offer the use of a physical security key ora passkey stored in your password manager, which is one of the highest safeguards toprevent account intrusions that rely on password-stealing malwareor phishing.Gmail lists all the places your account is activeThe first thing you should do if you suspect someone has broken into your Gmail account (and by extension all the other Google services linked to it) is to scroll all the way down in your inbox until you see \u201cLast account activity\u201d in the bottom right corner.Click on \u201cDetails.\u201d You will then see a pop-up window that looks like this:A list of recent account activity on Google\u2019s account page.Image Credit:TechCrunchThese are all the places where your Google account is active. If you don\u2019t recognize one of them, for example if it comes from a different location, like a country you haven\u2019t visited recently or never been, then click on \u201cSecurity Checkup.\u201d Here you can see what devices your Google account is active in.Google\u2019s Security Checkup Page, including a view that shows \u201cwhere you\u2019re signed in.\u201dImage Credits:TechCrunch.If you scroll down, you can also see \u201cRecent security activity.\u201dRecent security activity on Google\u2019s Security Checkup Page.Image Credits:TechCrunchCheck this list to see if there are any devices that you don\u2019t recognize. If in any of these places above you see something suspicious, click on \u201cSee unfamiliar activity?\u201d and change your password:Changing your Google account password.Image Credits:TechCrunchAfter you change your password,as Google explains here, you will be signed out of every device in every location, except on the \u201cdevices you use to verify that it\u2019s you when you sign in,\u201d and some devices with third-party apps that you\u2019ve granted account access to. If you want to sign out there too,go to this Google Support pageand click on the link to \u201cView the apps and services with third-party access.\u201dRemoving third-party access to your Google account.Image Credits:TechCrunchFinally, we also suggest considering turning onGoogle\u2019s Advanced Protection on your account. This enhanced security protection makes phishing your password and hacking into your Google account even harder. The drawback is that you need to purchase security keys, hardware devices that serve as a second-factor. But we thinkthis methodis important and a must-use for people who are at a higher risk.Also, remember that your email account is likely linked to all your other important accounts, so getting into it could turn out to be the first step into hacking into other accounts. That\u2019s why securing your email account is more important than virtually any other account.Outlook and Microsoft logins are in the account settingsIf you are concerned about hackers having accessed your Microsoft Outlook account, you can check \u201cwhen and where you\u2019ve signed in,\u201d as Microsoft puts it in the account settings.To go to that page, go toyour Microsoft Account, click on Security on the left-hand menu, and then under \u201cSign-in activity\u201d go to \u201cView my activity.\u201dChecking recent sign-in activity on your Microsoft account.Image Credits:TechCrunchAt this point, you should see a page that shows recent logins, what platform and device was used to log in, the type of browser, and the IP address.Checking recent activity on your Microsoft account.Image Credits:TechCrunchIf something looks off, click on \u201cLearn how to make your account more secure,\u201d where you can change your password, check \u201chow to recover a hacked or compromised account\u201c, and more.Microsoft also hasa support portal with information on the Recent activity page.As we noted above, your email account is the cornerstone of your online security, given that it\u2019s likely that most of your important accounts \u2014 think social media, bank, and healthcare provider etc. \u2014 are linked to it. It\u2019s a popular target for hackers who want to then compromise other accounts.Yahoo offers email tools to helpLike other email providers, Yahoo (which owns TechCrunch) also offers a tool to check your account and sign-in activity with the goal of allowing you to see any unusual activity that could be a sign of compromise.To access this tool, go toyour Yahoo My Account Overviewor click on the icon with your initial next to the email icon on the top right corner, and click on \u201cManage your account.\u201dAccessing your Yahoo account information.Image Credits:TechCrunchOnce there, click on \u201cReview recent activity.\u201d On this page you will be able to see recent activity on your account, including password changes, phone numbers added, and what devices are connected to your account, and their corresponding IP addresses.Checking recent account activity on your Yahoo account.Image Credits:TechCrunchChecking recent account activity on your Yahoo account.Image Credits:TechCrunchGiven that it is likely that you have linked your email address to sensitive websites like your bank\u2019s, your social media accounts, and healthcare portals, among others, you should make an extra effort to secure it.Ensure your Apple ID is safeApple allows you to check what devices your Apple ID is logged in directly through the iPhone and Mac system settings,as the company explains here.On an iPhone or iPad, go to \u201cSettings,\u201d tap your name, and scroll down to see all the devices that you are signed in on.A screenshot on an iPhone showing all the logged in devices on an Apple account.Image Credits:AppleOn a Mac, click on the Apple logo on the top left corner, then \u201cSystem Settings,\u201d then click on your name, and you will also see a list of devices, just like on an iPhone or iPad.A screenshot on a Mac showing all the logged in devices on an Apple account.Image Credits:AppleIf you click on any device, Apple says, you will be able to \u201cview that device\u2019s information, such as the device model, serial number,\u201d and operating system version.On Windows, you can use Apple\u2019s iCloud app to check what devices are logged into your account.

        "original_content": "There is a general consensus today that generative AI is going to transform business in a profound way, and companies and individuals who don\u2019t get on board will be quickly left in the dustbin of history.At the same time, as companies delve more deeply into this technology, they want proof, actual business metrics, that show how AI is actually improving business performance and revenue.They can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t trust vendor promises alone. Yet it\u2019s not easy to make a direct correlation between something like, say, Microsoft Copilot, and overall business performance.Should CIOs simply take it on faith then? In this week\u2019sClouded Judgement newsletter, investor Jamin Ball suggests that most businesses might not have a choice. In his view, they might not see the results for some time, leaving them to make a very tough buying decision.Here\u2019s Ball\u2019s take:\u201cRight now the world is evolving \u2014 AI is a massive platform shift. And by NOT adopting / spending on it, you risk losing market share and slowly becoming irrelevant. Because your competitors are investing in AI efforts, you also have to invest in AI efforts. At the end of the day these investments might not immediately result in better business outcomes (i.e., more revenue), but they certainly lead to better end user experiences. And very well may lead to better \u201cother\u201d metrics like retention or churn. If your competitors are building better end user experiences and you\u2019re not, then you may find yourself in trouble in the short / medium term,\u201d Ball wrote.Yet CIOs want more certainty than that before they go blindly into an expensive new technology, no matter how game changing it could be. They and the company CFO have to deal with the reality of the here and now when it comes to justifying expenses, and if they are spending big money, when can they reasonably expect to get a return on their investment?At the same time, those who use the electricity analogy for AI, may believe that this is AI\u2019selectricity moment\u2014 that moment in the late 18th century when factories began switching over from steam to electricity. You could ignore it and continue along with steam, but at some point you were going to get steamrolled (pun intended).Perhaps the answer could lie with some savvy startup, or more likely enterprises of a certain size will turn to the usual suspects \u2014 Deloitte, McKinsey and Accenture \u2014 and pay them a hefty fee to help them figure it out. Ironically, that will just increase the cost and the time to value.As the Grateful Dead\u2019s Jerry Garcia once sang in \u201cThe Wheel,\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t go back and you can\u2019t stand still. If the thunder won\u2019t get you, then the lightning will.\u201d CIOs trying to figure out how to proceed are left to decide whether they are marching their companies steadily toward the future, or throwing good money after bad.",
        "paraphrased_content": "## Generative AI: A Business Transformation with Uncertain ROI\n\nThere's a widespread belief that generative AI will revolutionize businesses, with companies lagging behind facing irrelevance. However, businesses demand concrete evidence of its impact on revenue and performance. \n\n**The Challenge:** Directly linking AI tools like Microsoft Copilot to overall business metrics is difficult. While investor Jamin Ball argues that companies cannot afford to ignore this trend, he acknowledges the lack of immediate return on investment. \n\n**Ball's Perspective:** He believes that investing in AI, despite the uncertain timeframe for tangible results, is necessary for staying competitive.  While immediate revenue gains might be elusive, AI can improve user experiences, potentially impacting metrics like retention and churn.\n\n**The CIO Dilemma:** Despite the potential benefits, CIOs are hesitant to commit to expensive AI initiatives without clear ROI projections. They face pressure to justify spending and demonstrate a return on investment. \n\n**The Electricity Analogy:** Some compare the current AI landscape to the transition from steam to electricity in the 18th century. Companies might choose to remain with legacy systems, but eventually, they will be outpaced by competitors embracing AI.\n\n**The Solution?**  Companies might turn to consulting firms like Deloitte, McKinsey, and Accenture for guidance, further increasing costs and delaying value realization. \n\n**The Bottom Line:** The pressure to adopt AI is mounting, yet the lack of immediate ROI presents a challenge. CIOs are forced to choose between embracing the future or risking irrelevance, facing the difficult task of navigating this uncertain territory. \n",

        "original_content": "Hank Green has had a while to think about how social media has changed us. He started making YouTube videos in 2007 with his brother, novelist John Green, at a time when the first iPhone was in development, MySpace was still relevant and Instagram didn\u2019t exist. Seventeen years later, posting videos on the internet is no longer just a hobby, but a$250 billionindustry. And yet, after all this time, the Green brothers remain two of the longest-tenured and most respected creators in the game.Now, in a time of addictive infinite scrolling and increased loneliness, Hank has grown pensive about his role as a content creator. But Green isn\u2019t an ordinary creator \u2013 he\u2019s started so many companies and projects online thatfans created a websitecounting how many days it\u2019s been since he\u2019s started something new.Green founded the crowdfunding platform Subbable, which Patreonacquiredin 2015, and he co-founded the companies DFTBA (an e-commerce company for creators) and Complexly (an educational media company). He was CEO of both of those companies until 2023, when he stepped down after he was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. Fortunately, Green is now in remission. He even performed astandup comedy specialabout the experience of cancer treatment, because he\u2019s Hank Green, and even chemotherapy can\u2019t stop him from making new things.Green\u2019s experience running startups, coupled with his tenure as a creator, gives him a valuable perspective on where the creator economy is going. As the downsides of social media become more obvious, Green is thoughtful about the power and attention that creators command.On one hand, the Green brothers have shown that social media can be used to change the world for the better. The brothers grew their fanbase of millions and harnessed their online community for good, from fundraising with Partners in Health for amaternal health centerin Sierra Leone, to persuading pharmaceutical company Danaher tolower the priceof life-saving Tuberculosis tests. Aside from their main channelvlogbrothers, the Greens also foundedCrash Course, a free, educational YouTube channel with 15.7 million subscribers, which has become ubiquitous in American classrooms.But for all the good that the internet can do, it\u2019s still isolating. If you\u2019re feeling lonely, it\u2019s a lot easier to keep scrolling TikTok than to call a friend.\u201cI am part of this problem \u2013 it\u2019s not just the algorithms, it\u2019s the content,\u201d Green told TechCrunch. \u201cI have been trained by the algorithms and by my colleagues to be extraordinarily good at grabbing and holding people\u2019s attention. I hope I use that skill for good, but I also use it for distracting people from whatever else they would be doing.\u201dCreators of Green\u2019s stature have a lot of power \u2013 they can reach millions of people at the push of a button. But they\u2019re making those connections on the platforms\u2019 turf, whether that\u2019s TikTok, YouTube or Instagram.\u201cI think I feel my power more than [social media executives] do, because I have more direct connection to audience, so I see the impact in a way that they don\u2019t,\u201d Green said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m talking to people who are making really big, important decisions at these platforms, they very much want to believe that they aren\u2019t important, and I don\u2019t get that luxury of believing that I am not that important, because I get people who say, \u2018You know, that video you made really hurt me,\u2019 or \u2018That video helped.\u2019\u201dInvesting in creatorsAt this year\u2019s VidCon \u2013 the online video conference that the Green brothers co-founded in 2010, then sold to Paramount \u2013 the creator economy is navigating its increased attention from the broader tech world. In the expo hall, teenagers are still cosplaying as Hatsune Miku and lining up for meet-and-greets with Minecraft YouTubers. But the scene is different upstairs on the \u201cindustry track,\u201d where venture capitalists likeSlow Ventures\u2019 Megan Lightcapare detailing the strategy behind investing in creators, andMatPatexplains how he managed to become one of the first creators to successfully sell their company.All creators are business owners, but Green goes beyond what\u2019s standard. During the industry\u2019sboom in VC funding, Green thought about investing in tools for creators, which makes sense given his background in founding Subbable.\u201cHonestly, in that moment, I was like, \u2018I should have done this. I should have started a fund,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNot that I didn\u2019t have other stuff to do \u2026 and it turns out it\u2019s very good I was too distracted, because probably I would\u2019ve lost a bunch of people\u2019s money, because it\u2019s hard to build businesses at all.\u201dThat\u2019s especially true for the creator economy, where there are so many different kinds of creators whose needs are ever-changing.\u201cCreators are so diverse in their needs that, to create a product that is scalable \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t cost a ton of money trying to individualize itself for each individual creator \u2013 you end up creating a bad product,\u201d Green said.In some cases, VCs have decided to invest in creators like they\u2019re individual startups. Other companies like Spotter give creators upfront capital in exchange for the ad revenue from their back catalog on YouTube. Green is interested in these funding models, though he describes investing in content creators as \u201cdeeply antithetical to the Silicon Valley VC playbook.\u201d That\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t believe creators are a good investment, but because creators don\u2019t scale at the same speed as the kind of startups that typically attract VCs.\u201cThis is just regular investing,\u201d Green said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something that\u2019s going to 10x.\u201dEven though the creator economy is less of a buzzword in Silicon Valley these days, the space is still growing \u2013 creator startups in the U.S. havealready raised more moneythis year than all of last year, mostly because of the AI boom, which Green sees as a fad.\u201cMy gut says that people want to connect with people,\u201d he said. \u201cA relationship with a creator is already artificial in some way\u2026 But I don\u2019t think AI will be that good at building audiences.\u201dCreators wrestle with platforms\u2019 powerCreators navigate the same challenges as any small business owner, but they\u2019re also subject to the unpredictability of social platforms and consumers\u2019 changing interests. These big tech companies are incentivized to generate as much engagement as they can, and if a small tweak to an algorithm can mean your videos stop showing up on TikTok\u2019s For You Page, then creators are left feeling helpless. And if a creator loses access to their account \u2013 sometimes via coordinated reporting campaigns by bad actors \u2013 it\u2019s not likely they\u2019ll be able to get in touch with someone from the platform to help.Green tried forming a trade organization called the Internet Creators Guild in 2016, but it only stayed afloat for three years \u2013 it\u2019s proven challenging to form a unified advocacy body for creators, since the industry is so decentralized.\u201c[SAG-AFTRA members] do the same job for the same few companies, but we all do very different jobs for the same companies,\u201d Green said, referring to creators\u2019 dependence on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and others. \u201cA person doing textile art and then selling it on Etsy has a very different set of needs than a musician.\u201d\u201cThere are some things that everyone agrees on \u2013 like, there should be recourse when your account stops existing,\u201d Green said. \u201cIf I lived in a town and started a business there, the town shouldn\u2019t be able to just come and put a bike lock on my door and say, \u2018You don\u2019t own that business anymore.\u2019\u201dEven creators who watch their star rise live with the anxiety that they might not always retain their audience. That\u2019s a power that social media platforms have over the creators who make their apps worth our time.\u201cThe bad part of TikTok \u2013 being that you\u2019re infinitely replaceable \u2013 is also the good part of TikTok,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are so easy to discover. Talent discovery has never been this powerful.\u201dAndy Warhol\u2019s adage about our fifteen minutes of fame has never been more realistic. Characters likeReesa Teesa, the\u201cHawk Tuah\u201d girland theFour Seasons Orlando babycapture our attention, then rush to sign with talent agencies and try to turn their one shining moment into a full-fledged career. But the speed at which these people become household names \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 is evidence of a growing anxiety among creators that their fortune could run out.And then there\u2019s creators like Hank Green. He was there when you were a kid struggling with biology, he\u2019s still here when he pops up on your TikTok with a weird science fact, and hopefully, he\u2019ll stick around a while longer.",
        "paraphrased_content": "## Hank Green: A Creator's Perspective on the Ever-Evolving Social Media Landscape\n\n**Hank Green, a veteran content creator who started on YouTube in 2007 with his brother John, has witnessed the dramatic evolution of social media.

He believes that while creators represent a valuable investment, they don't scale as quickly as traditional startups, making them less attractive to VCs.**\n\n**He also highlights the power imbalance between creators and platforms, which can leave creators vulnerable to algorithm changes and account suspensions. Green's own attempt to form a trade organization for creators, the Internet Creators Guild, underscores the difficulty of unifying such a decentralized industry.**\n\n**Despite the challenges, Green remains optimistic about the future of the creator economy. He believes that while AI may contribute to the creation of content, it's unlikely to replace the human connection that drives audiences to follow specific creators.**\n\n**He acknowledges that creators, like any other business owner, face the constant pressure to maintain relevance in a rapidly evolving landscape. The constant cycle of fleeting fame on platforms like TikTok creates anxiety for creators, who are acutely aware that their popularity can be fleeting.**\n\n**Green, however, remains a testament to the enduring power of genuine connection and the ability to build a lasting audience.  His longevity as a creator, coupled with his commitment to creating meaningful content, makes him a unique example in the ever-shifting world of social media.** \n",

For instance, a software provider that specialized in payroll for 1099 contractor-heavy businesses used Synapse to provide an instant payment feature; others used it to offer specialized credit/debit cards.The San Francisco-based startup raised a total of just over $50 million in venture capital in its lifetime, including a 2019$33 million Series B raiseled by Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s Angela Strange. Synapsewobbled in 2023 with layoffsandfiled for Chapter 11in April of this year, hoping to sell its assets in a $9.7 million fire sale to another fintech, TabaPay. ButTabaPay walked.The result was that Synapse was forced to liquidate entirely under Chapter 7 and a lot of other fintechs such as Juno, Yotta and Yieldstreet \u2014 and their customers \u2014 are paying the price for Synapse\u2019s demise.The debacle has left observersquestioning the banking-as-a-service concept and digital banking as a whole, considering that millions of consumers with nearly $160 million in deposits remain unable to access their funds.Here is a timeline of Synapse\u2019s troubles and the ongoing impact it is having on banking consumers.2024Nearly $160 million in funds still frozenJuly 7:Fintech Business Weekly reports that a recent \u201cstatus conferencein the ongoing Synapse bankruptcy didn\u2019t offer much hope to end users whose funds were still frozen, with efforts to reconcile and release the remaining funds, approximately $158.6 million, appearing to slow.\u201d This means that about $158.6 million was still owed to end users.\u00a0However, there was an estimated $65 million to $95 million in funds that were missing.Senators urge Synapse and its partners and backers to restore customers\u2019 access to their moneyJuly 1:A group of senators banded together to urge Synapse\u2019s owners and bank and fintech partners to\u201cimmediately restore customers\u2019 access to their money.\u201dAs part of their demands, the senators implicated both the partners and the venture investors of the company as being responsible for missing customer funds.Synapse CEO moves on to starting another companyJune 12:Synapse\u2019s CEO Sankaet Pathak has reportedly alreadyraised $10 millionfor a new robotics startup even whilequestions remainedon the whereabouts of $85 million in Synapse\u2019s customer savings.Fallout continues, more fintechs and millions of consumers affectedMay 25:Based on Synapse\u2019s filings,as many as 100 fintechs and 10 million end customerswere potentially impacted by the company\u2019s collapse by the end of May. For instance, funds at crypto app Juno and banking platform Yotta were also impacted by Synapse\u2019s collapse. Meanwhile,Mainvest, a fintech lender to restaurant businesses, said it was actually shutting down as a result.U.S. Trustee pushes for Chapter 7May 16:A United States trustee filed an emergency motion to convert Synapse\u2019s debt reorganization Chapter 11 bankruptcy into aliquidation Chapter 7. The trustee said that Synapse had \u201cgrossly\u201d mismanaged its estate so that losses were continuing with little \u201creasonable likelihood of reorganization\u201d that would allow the company to emerge on the other side and carry on.Customer teen banking startup Copper discontinues its banking operationsMay 13: Synapse customer teen banking startup Copper had toabruptly discontinue its banking deposit accounts and debit cardsas a result of Synapse\u2019s difficulties. That left an unknown number of consumers, mostly families, without access to the funds they had trustingly deposited into Copper\u2019s accounts.Sale of assets called offMay 9: TabaPay said it hadabandoned its plansto purchase Synapse\u2019s assets. There was lots of finger-pointing when that deal dissolved. Synapse\u2019s CEO made accusations\u00a0 that the problem was banking partner Evolve Bank & Trust. And Evolve denied those charges, saying it was not involved, and not to blame.

Evolve and Synapse addressed the brouhahahere.October 6: Synapse confirmed that it hadlaid off86 people, or about 40% of the company. That was just four months after the company had let go of 18% of its workforce as \u201cthe current macroeconomic conditions\u201d had begun to impact its clients and platforms, affecting its anticipated growth.

        "original_content": "When Helixx co-founder and CEO Steve Pegg looks at Daisy \u2014 the startup\u2019s 3D printed prototype delivery van\u00a0 \u2014 he sees a second chance. And he\u2019s pulling inspiration from McDonald\u2019s to get there.The prototype, which made its global debut this week at theGoodwood Festival of Speed, is an interesting proof of concept. Virtually every part of Daisy has been 3D printed with 14 consumer printers from Creality using standard PLA+ filament. Even the steering wheel bears the unmistakable layer lines of a printer just short of professional grade.But for Helixx, the story is less about an endearingly boxy little van designed to cost just $6,000 and more about rebooting everything we know about building cars.Helixx wants to manufacture hundreds of thousands of these runabouts in pop-up factories adjacent to some of the world\u2019s most dense and dynamic cities. The kicker is that Helixx\u2019s multi-tiered revenue model has little to do with the actual act of manufacturing.Even the steering wheel on the Helixx EV delivery van has been 3D printed.Image credits: Tim StevensYes, it sounds a bit likedearly departedEV startup Arrival\u2019s plan, which Pegg is deeply familiar with. Prior to co-founding Helixx in 2022, Pegg was product line director at Arrival and also took on a role overseeing lightweight vehicle development there. He\u2019s now refining some of those core concepts with Helixx, which launched in June a$20 million Series A fundraising roundbased on a pre-money valuation of $100 million. The startup raised $1.3 million in seed funding last year.There are some key differences between Arrival and Helixx, according to Pegg, who has 25 years in and around the automotive logistics game.McDonald\u2019s meets EVsWhere one of Arrival\u2019s core concepts was automation, Helixx is largely about getting factories up to speed quickly, staffing them with human beings after minimal training.\u201cThe principle is very similar to a McDonald\u2019s franchise. You don\u2019t need to be a chef to know how to build burgers, and McDonald\u2019s doesn\u2019t teach you how to be a chef,\u201d Pegg said. \u201cThey teach you how to follow a process.\u201dIn an hour-long conversation, Pegg referenced McDonald\u2019s five times, showing just how influential the fast-food franchise model is to Helixx\u2019s concept. And, just like when you\u2019re slinging burgers with slim margins, volume is critical.At a top level, Helixx is looking for partners who want to get into the last-mile mobility-as-a-service business and who want full control of vehicle manufacturing. For a fee, Helixx will provide access to a complete platform that covers everything from component sourcing all the way through to fleet management and even eventual vehicle refurbishment, services built at least in part on the Siemens Xcelerator platform.\u201cIt all starts with a license,\u201d Pegg said, something like $50 million for a company to get into the platform. This opens the door to start planning to deploy a \u201cfactory in a box,\u201d which could go from greenfield to producing cars in as few as 180 days.That then opens the door to a second revenue tier: selling the components that fill the factory and actually makes the cars.Helixx handles all the supply chain logistics for the client, sourcing materials and components. Once vehicles start rolling off the line, Helixx takes a monthly service fee of roughly $80 per vehicle produced. The company also gets a $500 royalty on every vehicle put into service.Helixx also plans to track usage data from all the vehicles, a potentially valuable commodity itself that could then be sold to anyone perhaps interested in city planning or fleet logistics.The Helixx vans are intended for commercial use. The company sees an opportunity to unleash the vans in cities like Jakarta or Bangkok, where tuk-tuks or auto rickshaws \u2014 the ubiquitous three-wheeled demons that fill the air with the shrill cry and emissions of two-stroke engines \u2014 are the norm.EV van by the numbersDaisy (more formally known as the Helixx Cargo) is all-electric, but she\u2019s not rechargeable. At least, not directly. Conceptually, at least, Daisy will run on swappable, lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) cells. But if you\u2019re getting shades ofBetter Place, don\u2019t. Unlike that startup, which relied on complicated, automated swapping stations, Helixx\u2019s solution is much more likeGogoro.The battery pack Helixx\u2019s EV is modular, with each module weighing 25 pounds and providing two kWh of capacity. Users can simply slot in as many as they need, up to a maximum of six. When they\u2019re drained, instead of recharging, users will pull up to an Amazon Locker-like location and swap them by hand.The vehicle fits within Europe\u2019s L7E Heavy Quadricycle category, meaning it has a maximum speed of just 55 miles per hour. Pegg says it will weigh under 1,200 pounds (less than one-quarter the weight of aFord E-Transit) and will be bereft of anything more than the bare necessities. Pegg wants to go back to a time of simple cars with roll-up windows.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to attract a user that needs a workhorse to do his job and take more money home,\u201d Pegg said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to turn those attributes around and think, what does the driver actually need?\u201dSubscribe to driveTo access one of the Helixx EVs, those drivers will need a subscription. In exchange for a monthly fee, subscribers will receive access to a vehicle for a set number of hours or days per month.\u201cLike a Netflix subscription,\u201d Pegg said, \u201cwhether you\u2019re using it or not.\u201d He says this will help Helixx (and its franchisees) avoid the uneven, demand-based revenue peaks and valleys that plague other mobility services.Pegg also envisions a sky-high 95% utilization rate. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a vehicle of convenience,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going into those drivers that need these vehicles to do that job, to take more money home to their family.\u201dSince the factories will be conceptually scalable, the local franchisee can adjust to meet demand. Still, Pegg said Helixx isn\u2019t interested in talking with anyone not prepared to build a factory capable of producing at least 100,000 cars per year, something that he estimates would take roughly 50,000 square feet of building space.That may seem like an aspirational figure; roughly one-fifth the annual production of Tesla\u2019s Fremont factory in a space one-hundredth the size. But, given Helixx\u2019s little van is significantly smaller and more simple than even a Tesla, it may be more feasible than it seems at first blush.And, no, Helixx\u2019s factories won\u2019t be full of 3D printers. That was just for prototyping. In proper production, roughly 20% of the vehicle will be made of polymers, but shaped by more traditional pressing techniques. Another 45% of the van\u2019s basic components, like the metal frame and suspension, will be cast and sourced locally.Another 20% of the vehicle, including basic electronics and systems, will come from more advanced regional suppliers. The remaining 15% will be single-source components such as airbags, battery cells, or other equipment requiring some level of certification or precision manufacturing.Pegg says the supply chain service and solutions Helixx is developing will ensure the cheapest, most efficient sourcing for all that, and he hopes that part of that will come from OEM partners. Helixx is actively targeting the corporate venture capital arms of manufacturers like Toyota and Hyundai for this Series A round.Pegg believes Helixx can help these manufacturers crack open a new vehicle subscription model by dramatically lowering the cost of entry. Where subscription services likeCare by Volvoare comparable to the cost of leasing and insuring a vehicle, Helixx\u2019s vehicles would be substantially lower.But the $6,000 Daisy van you see here (named after \u201cDaisy Bell,\u201d the first song sung by a computer) is just the beginning. Pegg says other vehicles could come in time, which franchisees could simply download and immediately begin producing in their modular factories.\u201cAs long as you\u2019ve got a license, of course.\u201d",
